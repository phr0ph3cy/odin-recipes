        <h1>Peanut Butter Blossoms</h1>
        <img src="/home/phr0ph3cy/repos/odin-recipes/recipes/images/pbblossom.jpeg">
        <h3>Peanut butter and chocolate come together in these great cookies made with Gold Medal® all-purpose flour. Ready in an hour!</h3>
        <p>The ideal version of this treat starts with a thick, soft peanut butter cookie. I don't have the fond memories of peanut butter blossoms from my childhood that some of you might have—I wasn't introduced to these beloved treats until later in life—but I do have a longstanding love for peanut butter blossoms</p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>

        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
