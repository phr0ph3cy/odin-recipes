    <h3>Tart, rich and perfection, all rolled into one! Wow your friends with this simple recipe.</h3>
    <p>Lemon bars are one of the EASIEST desserts to make but theyre guaranteed to bring a smile to your face. I love the soft lemon filling paired with a crisp shortbread crust and the flavor is beyond delicious; so bright and zingy with all the lemon flavor from the juice and zest, theyre simply irresistible!</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flo</li> 
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>2 lemons, juiced</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, blend together softened butter, 2 cups flour and 1/2 cup sugar. Press into the bottom of an ungreased 9x13 inch pan.</li>
        <li>Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm and golden. In another bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 1/2 cups sugar and 1/4 cup flour. Whisk in the eggs and lemon juice. Pour over the baked crust.

        </li>
        <li>Bake for an additional 20 minutes in the preheated oven. The bars will firm up as they cool. For a festive tray, make another pan using limes instead of lemons and adding a drop of green food coloring to give a very pale green. After both pans have cooled, cut into uniform 2 inch squares and arrange in a checker board fashion.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
